        "In prior notebooks, I experimented with one variable; lambda, the value the cost-matrix takes on for whatever misclassification we are interested in.  The seeded neural network we trained using a normal cost-matrix of all ones usually had a higher misclassification count on the **T**rue 9s being mislabelled by the model **P**redicting 4s, which you will sometimes see written as \"9T, 4P\" and \"w[9t,4p]\" when referring to the cost of the misclassification.\n",

        "We changed the lambda values and allowed as many epochs of training with  early-stopping and a patience of 10 to conclude once training was beginnnig to overfit the validation data (also the test set).   Lambda values chosen were 1, 10, 100, and 1000.   These values were chosen because it seemed that only very high values like 1000 could drive down the number of misclassifications of 9T,4P to zero.\n",

        "In this notebook, continuing to use a relatively balanced dataset, we're going to also experiment with a second variable, time of training.  This is a little more tricky to define because the variable lambda is thought to have an impact on the number of epochs needed.  Therefore if you have a certain lambda value in the beginning of training, you may only need 10 total epochs of training, but if you use it at the end of training, you may need more epochs of training.  In addition there is the question as to whether we should define   a static number of epochs or to allow early stopping.  \n",
