The next group of misclassifications happens around when the cost of misclassification is '100' in the first phase.  And finally the last group of misclassifications, which is the highest overall, is in the cost of misclassifications that are '1' in the initial phase.  It doesn't apppear that the second phase makes a large difference overall in any of the groups.  For example 1-1-1, which is a constant rate of '1' cost seems to have the same results   as other runs where the second phase was 1000."
